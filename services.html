                    <h3>website design</h3>
                <p>The concept of web design and development has been around for about as long as websites have existed. It used to have a much simpler definition because website creation used to be a much simpler process.

                    When you compare the first website, which came out in 1991, to modern websites, you can really see how much websites have evolved. Today, creating and maintaining a website is more complex, and involves an entire ecosystem of roles and skill sets.
                    
                    For designers, it can be difficult to know exactly where you fit into this ecosystem»</p>

                <h3>website maintenance</h3>
            <p>Your website is the foundation of your business’s online presence. People visit it to learn about your company, find your contact information, and purchase your products.

                If your website isn’t working properly or is out of date, you may lose out on significant opportunities, such as new leads and sales.
                
                Since 94% of first impressions relate to web design, people may come away with a poor first impression of your business if your site isn’t up to date and functional. Additionally, if you’re an ecommerce business and your ecommerce functionality fails, people won’t be able to purchase your products. »</p>

            <h3>website hosting</h3>
        <p>Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser.</p>
